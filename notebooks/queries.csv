1,"How do I measure tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance on CT?","To measure the TT-TG distance on CT:

1. Superimpose axial images of the femoral condyles and tibial tuberosity
2. Draw a line along the posterior femoral condyles
3. Draw perpendicular lines:
- One bisecting the tibial tuberosity (TT)
- One bisecting the trochlear groove sulcus (TG)
4. Measure the distance between these two lines, which is the TT-TG distance

The normal TT-TG distance is generally considered to be <15 mm, with 15-20 mm being borderline and >20 mm considered abnormal.","2024-11-06 09:16:34"
2,"what is the ac pc line?","The AC-PC line (anterior commissure-posterior commissure line) is a standard reference plane in neuroimaging used for axial imaging. It is a line that passes through the superior edge of the anterior commissure and the inferior edge of the posterior commissure on midline sagittal images. This line provides a consistent orientation for brain imaging, making it easier to compare different exams. It is typically about 9 degrees steeper than the traditionally used orbitomeatal line in CT imaging.","2024-11-06 09:22:17"

4,"mcdonald criteria 2017","Based on the 2017 McDonald criteria, the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be made in five different scenarios:

1. ≥2 clinical attacks, with ≥2 lesions and objective clinical evidence (no additional data needed)

2. ≥2 clinical attacks, with 1 lesion and objective clinical evidence, plus a clinical history suggestive of a previous lesion (no additional data needed)

3. ≥2 clinical attacks, with 1 lesion and objective clinical evidence, requiring dissemination in space on MRI

4. 1 clinical attack (clinically isolated syndrome) with ≥2 lesions, requiring either:
- Dissemination in time on MRI, or
- Demonstration of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands

5. 1 clinical attack (clinically isolated syndrome) with 1 lesion, requiring:
- Dissemination in space on MRI
- Dissemination in time on MRI, or demonstration of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands

Dissemination in space requires ≥1 T2-hyperintense lesions in two or more of these locations:
- Periventricular
- Cortical or juxtacortical
- Infratentorial
- Spinal cord

Dissemination in time can be established by either:
- A new T2-hyperintense or gadolinium-enhancing lesion compared to a previous scan
- Simultaneous presence of a gadolinium-enhancing lesion and a non-enhancing T2-hyperintense lesion on one MRI scan","2024-11-06 09:53:23"
5,"tell me more about ADEM. what are the triggers and how does it look on MRI? ","ADEM is typically triggered by a viral infection or vaccination that occurs 1-2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. It most commonly affects children and adolescents under 15 years old, with seasonal peaks observed in winter and spring.

On MRI, ADEM presents with distinctive characteristics:
- Lesions are usually in white matter, with regions of high signal on T2
- Can have peripheral enhancement on T1 with contrast (often showing punctate, ring or arc enhancement)
- Lesions are typically bilateral but asymmetrical
- Can involve subcortical locations, with potential involvement of thalami and brainstem
- Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) shows peripherally restricted diffusion
- The center of lesions has increased extracellular water but does not have increased restriction

The pathology is thought to be an autoimmune response, with about half of cases showing anti-MOG antibodies. Clinically, patients may experience fever, headache, decreased consciousness, seizures, and various neurological symptoms. Most patients (50-60%) completely recover within a month, though some may have lasting sequelae or, in rare cases (10-20%), a more severe outcome.","2024-11-06 10:13:58"
6,"what is wallerian degeneration?","Wallerian degeneration is the process of antegrade degeneration of axons and their accompanying myelin sheaths following a proximal axonal or neuronal cell body injury. It can occur due to various causes such as cerebral infarction, trauma, necrosis, focal demyelination, or hemorrhage. The process involves the progressive breakdown of axons and myelin sheaths distal to the site of injury, which can be divided into four stages that span from weeks to months or years, ultimately resulting in atrophy of the white matter tracts.","2024-11-06 10:32:08"
7,"what is laminar necrosis and how does it look on mri? ","Cortical laminar necrosis is a condition where specific layers of the cerebral cortex undergo cell death. On MRI, it appears as a gyriform (curved/ribbon-like) T1 hyperintense signal involving the cerebral cortex. This means the affected cortical layers will look brighter on T1-weighted images. The hyperintensity is likely due to the accumulation of denatured proteins and changes in the cortical tissue after neuronal cell death.","2024-11-06 10:33:21"
8,"are there ways to differentiation radiation necrosis from tumor progression in glioblastoma?","Yes, there are several ways to differentiate radiation necrosis from tumor progression in glioblastoma:

1. Timing:
- Radiation necrosis typically occurs later (>12 months after treatment)
- Pseudoprogression usually occurs within the first 3-6 months after treatment

2. Advanced MRI sequences can help:
- Perfusion:
* Radiation necrosis/pseudoprogression: reduced cerebral blood volume
* Tumor progression: elevated cerebral blood volume

- Spectroscopy:
* Radiation necrosis/pseudoprogression:
- Low choline
- Increased lactate and lipid peaks
- Flat metabolite trace
* Tumor progression: High choline, low lipid and lactate

- Diffusion (ADC values):
* Radiation necrosis/pseudoprogression: Elevated ADC values (≥1300 x 10-6 mm2/s)
* Tumor progression: Lower ADC values

3. Location: Radiation necrosis/pseudoprogression typically occurs within the radiation field (60 Gy)

4. Clinical status: Patients with radiation necrosis/pseudoprogression often remain clinically stable","2024-11-06 12:28:25"
9,pneumonitis,"Pneumonitis is a broad medical term that indicates inflammation of the lung, specifically referring to inflammation of the pulmonary interstitium in clinical practice and radiology.

10,"mcdonald criteria","The McDonald criteria are diagnostic guidelines used to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS). They involve clinical, radiographic, and laboratory criteria that can be applied in different scenarios:

For patients with ≥2 clinical attacks:
- If there are ≥2 lesions with objective clinical evidence, no additional data is needed
- If there is 1 lesion with a suggestive clinical history of a previous lesion, no additional data is needed
- If there is 1 lesion without a suggestive history, dissemination in space on MRI is required

For patients with 1 clinical attack (clinically isolated syndrome):
- With ≥2 lesions, dissemination in time on MRI or CSF-specific oligoclonal bands are needed
- With 1 lesion, both dissemination in space and time on MRI (or CSF oligoclonal bands) are required

Dissemination in space requires lesions in at least two of four locations: periventricular, cortical/juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal cord.

Dissemination in time can be established by:
- A new lesion compared to a previous scan
- Simultaneous presence of a gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing T2 lesion

12,"tell me something about adem. what are the triggers and how does it look on MRI?","ADEM is an acute inflammatory condition affecting the brain's white matter, typically occurring in children and adolescents following a recent viral infection or vaccination. The triggers are most commonly:

1. Viral infections (within 1-2 weeks prior)
2. Vaccinations (though less than 5% of cases follow immunization)

On MRI, ADEM presents with the following characteristics:

T2 imaging:
- Regions of high signal
- Surrounding edema
- Typically situated in subcortical locations
- Can involve thalami and brainstem

T1 Contrast (Gd):
- Punctate, ring, or arc enhancement
- Often shows an ""open ring sign"" along the leading edge of inflammation

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI):
- Can show peripherally restricted diffusion
- Center of lesion has increased extracellular water
- Does not show increased restriction like a cerebral abscess

The lesions are usually bilateral but asymmetrical, distributed in supratentorial or infratentorial white matter. They can vary from punctate to tumefactive regions, and interestingly, the mass effect can be less than expected for their size.","2024-11-06 13:07:58"
13,"how can I differentiate a hepatic adenoma from a focal nodulary hyperplasia in MRI? ","Based on the MRI characteristics described in the context:

Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH):
- Bright arterial phase enhancement
- Isodense/isointense to liver on portal venous phase
- Central scar enhancement on delayed phase

Hepatic Adenoma:
- Transient homogeneous enhancement in arterial phase
- Returns to near isodensity on portal venous and delayed phase images

The key differences are the presence of a central scar in FNH (which enhances on delayed phase) and the slightly different enhancement patterns in the different MRI phases.","2024-11-06 13:19:59"
14,"McDonald criteria","The McDonald criteria are diagnostic guidelines used to identify multiple sclerosis. They were originally developed in 2001 by neurologist Ian McDonald and have been revised multiple times, most recently in 2017 and with a preliminary update in 2024.

The criteria provide specific requirements for diagnosing multiple sclerosis based on:
- Number of clinical attacks
- MRI lesion characteristics
- Dissemination in space (lesions in multiple brain/spinal cord regions)

- Presence of CSF oligoclonal bands

The diagnostic criteria vary depending on whether a patient has:
- 2 or more clinical attacks
- 1 clinical attack (clinically isolated syndrome)
- Primary progressive multiple sclerosis

The 2024 update proposes additional changes, including:
- Adding optic nerve involvement as a diagnostic site
- Using new imaging and CSF biomarkers
- Allowing MS diagnosis in radiologically isolated syndrome under certain conditions

These criteria help clinicians systematically evaluate and confirm multiple sclerosis diagnosis by using a combination of clinical, radiographic, and laboratory evidence.","2024-11-06 13:27:29"
15,"how do i measure the cobb angle? ","To measure the Cobb angle:

1. Identify the end vertebrae of the curve deformity - these are the vertebrae whose endplates are most tilted towards each other.

2. Draw lines along the endplates of these end vertebrae. If the endplates are not clearly visible, you can draw lines along the pedicles instead.

3. Measure the angle between these two lines where they intersect.

4. If the lines do not intersect on the film/monitor, draw two additional lines at right angles to the original lines.

Most Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) have a dedicated angle measurement tool that can help you do this without manually drawing intersecting lines.","2024-11-06 13:29:02"

17,"what is the etiology of laminar cortical necrosis?","Laminar cortical necrosis occurs due to situations that impair the brain's ability to provide sufficient nutrients to its neurons. This can happen through two primary mechanisms:

1. Reduced supply of nutrients:
- Hypoxia
- Ischemia
- Hypoglycemia
- Cerebral hypoperfusion (due to cardiac arrest or hypotension)
- Watershed (border zone) distribution due to hypotension and vessel stenosis
- Severe anemia
- Cyanide poisoning

2. Increased metabolic demand:
- Status epilepticus (which increases brain's need for glucose and oxygen)

The underlying reason is the high metabolic activity of cortical neurons compared to glial cells and white matter. Certain cortical layers (particularly the third layer) are more vulnerable to metabolic stress, with different brain regions having varying susceptibilities. The selective vulnerability may be due to higher metabolic demands and denser concentrations of excitatory amino acid receptors.","2024-11-07 07:10:58"
18,"cortical t1 hyperintensities","Cortical T1 hyperintensities are curvilinear hyperintense signals involving the cerebral cortex on T1-weighted brain MRI images. They can be caused by several conditions, including:

2. Cortical laminar necrosis
3. Accumulation of methemoglobin in cortical hemorrhagic infarcts
4. Vascular thrombo-occlusive disease
5. Cerebral venous thrombosis
6. Intracerebral hemorrhage
7. Herpes simplex (HSV) encephalitis

- Low signal in cystic areas (if present)

T1 with contrast (Gd):
- Prominent enhancement
- Heterogeneous in 70% of cases

T2 imaging:
- Somewhat hyperintense to brain tissue
- Cystic areas are hyperintense

Other notable features:
- Larger tumors may show hemosiderin staining on T2* sequences
- Higher signal on both DWI and ADC sequences (without true restricted diffusion)

MRI is considered the investigation of choice for assessing these tumors due to its high contrast resolution and ability to provide detailed anatomical information.","2024-11-07 13:00:38"
20,"how does a spinal neurinoma look like  on MRI? ","Based on the context, on MRI, spinal schwannomas (neurinomas) typically have the following characteristics:

1. Signal characteristics:
- T1: 75% are isointense, 25% are hypointense
- T2: More than 95% are hyperintense, often with mixed signal
- T1 with contrast: Virtually 100% enhance

2. Appearance:
- Solid, well-defined, rounded lesions
- Can be sausage-shaped when large, extending over several levels
- May protrude out of the neural foramen, forming a dumbbell-shaped mass

3. Additional features:
- Often associated with hemorrhage
- May have intrinsic vascular changes
- Can have cyst formation and fatty degeneration

25,"tell me something about fatty lesions in the cerebellopontine angle","Intracranial lipomas can occur in the cerebellopontine angle, accounting for approximately 10% of intracranial lipoma locations. In these cases, the facial nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve often course through the lipoma. These lipomas are congenital lesions and are typically asymptomatic, often discovered incidentally during brain imaging. They are not tumors, but rather result from abnormal differentiation of embryologic meninx primitiva. On imaging, they appear as fat-density masses with characteristic high signal intensity on T1 and T2 MRI sequences, and they do not enhance with contrast.","2024-11-08 08:52:34"
