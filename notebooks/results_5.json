It is the most aggressive type of glioma and is classified as a grade IV tumor by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n*   **CNS Lymphoma**: Secondary CNS lymphoma can manifest with symptoms such as new-onset headache, cranial nerve palsies, changes in mental status, and even coma and seizures.\n*   **Glioblastoma**: The clinical presentation of GBM depends on the tumor's location and can include symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and focal neurological deficits.\n\n### Radiographic Features\n\n*   **CNS Lymphoma**: On MRI, secondary CNS lymphoma can appear as leptomeningeal, dural, subependymal, and cranial nerve enhancement. Parenchymal involvement can appear similar to primary CNS lymphoma.\n*   **Glioblastoma**: Cystic glioblastoma, a descriptive term for glioblastoma with a large cystic component, typically appears as a well-defined intra-axial cystic lesion with peripheral ring enhancement on CT or MRI.

The prognosis for GBM remains poor, with a median survival of around 15-20 months with standard treatment.\n\n### Metastasis\n\n*   **CNS Lymphoma**: Secondary CNS lymphoma is a result of systemic lymphoma spreading to the CNS.\n*   **Glioblastoma**: Metastatic glioblastoma is rare, occurring in around 0.4-0.5% of cases.
