       "  'answer': \"The medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) score, also known as Scheltens' scale, helps distinguish patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease from those without impairment. It is useful in the assessment of patients with possible dementia.\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\nThe MTA score has a sensitivity of ~75% and specificity of ~85% to discriminate Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls. Although the MTA score has been widely used, it does not capture entorhinal cortex atrophy, which has been shown to occur early in the development of Alzheimer's disease. An additional scoring system, entorhinal cortical atrophy (ERICA), has been developed which is reported as having better diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing healthy controls from those with Alzheimer's disease.\\n\\n### Classification\\n\\nThe MTA score is a visual score performed on MRI of the brain using coronal T1 weighted images in a plane parallel to the brainstem axis and through the hippocampus at the level of the anterior pons. The score is also validated for assessment on CT brain. Both sides are evaluated, and the higher or the average score have been used for further grading by various authors. It is based on three features:\\n\\n*   Width of the choroid fissure\\n*   Width of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle\\n*   Height of the hippocampus\\n\\nThese result in a score of 0 to 4:\\n\\n*   **0**: no CSF is visible around the hippocampus\\n*   **1**: choroid fissure is slightly widened\\n*   **2**: moderate widening of the choroid fissure, mild enlargement of the temporal horn, and mild loss of hippocampal height\\n*   **3**: marked widening of the choroid fissure, moderate enlargement of the temporal horn, and moderate loss of hippocampal height\\n*   **4**: marked widening of the choroid fissure, marked enlargement of the temporal horn, and the hippocampus is markedly atrophied and internal structure is lost\\n\\n### Interpretation\\n\\nThe score is interpreted in relation to age:\\n\\n*   <75 years: ≥2 is abnormal\\n*   ≥75 years: ≥3 is abnormal\\n\\nA more detailed cut-off for an abnormal average score has been proposed:\\n\\n*   <65 years: ≥1 is abnormal\\n*   65-74 years: ≥1.5 is abnormal\\n*   75-84 years: ≥2 is abnormal\\n*   \\\\>85 years: ≥2 is abnormal\\n\\nIt has also been noted that the exact cut-off has limited value above the age of 85 due to the substantial decrease in sensitivity. Additionally, gender, age, and education were found to be confounders of the score. High scores have been shown to be present in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, although parietal atrophy will be seen in the former. Atrophy has been shown to correlate with the likelihood of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia.\\n\",\n",

       "  'answer': 'MRI has revolutionized the diagnosis and surveillance of patients with MS. Not only can an MRI confirm the diagnosis, but follow-up scans can assess response to treatment and help determine the disease pattern.\\n\\nThe 2018 Revised Guidelines of the Consortium of MS Centers MRI Protocol for the Diagnosis and Follow-up of MS plaques lists the following core sequences:\\n\\n*   FLAIR (axial and sagittal)\\n*   T1: 3D inversion recovery prepared gradient echo\\n*   T2 (axial): 3D or 2D\\n*   DWI (axial)\\n\\nHere are typical MRI findings of MS plaques:\\n\\n*   **T1:** Lesions are typically iso- to hypointense (T1 black holes). The callososeptal interface may have multiple small hypointense lesions (Venus necklace), or the corpus callosum may merely appear thinned. Hyperintense lesions are associated with brain atrophy and advancing disease.\\n*   **T2:** Lesions are typically hyperintense. Acute lesions often have surrounding edema.\\n*   **FLAIR:** Lesions are typically hyperintense. A very early sign is the ependymal dot-dash sign. When these propagate centrifugally along the medullary venules and are arranged perpendicular to the lateral ventricles in a triangular configuration (extending radially outward - best seen on parasagittal images), they are termed Dawson fingers. FLAIR is more sensitive than T2 in the detection of juxtacortical and periventricular plaques, while T2 is more sensitive to infratentorial lesions.\\n*   **Double inversion recovery (DIR):** A sequence that suppresses both CSF and white matter signal and offers better delineation of the plaques compared to FLAIR.\\n*   **SWI:** At higher field strengths, most plaques have been shown to be perivenular. Paramagnetic rim lesions may be seen in approximately 50% of patients; presence increases specificity of diagnosis and correlates with disability from disease.\\n*   **T1 C+ (Gd):** Active lesions show enhancement. Enhancement is often incomplete around the periphery (open ring sign).\\n*   **DWI/ADC:** Active plaques may demonstrate high or low ADC (increased or decreased diffusion) and also typically open ring in morphology.\\n*   **PD:** PD images are better at detecting cervical spinal cord MS lesions, especially when T2W images fail to demonstrate these lesions.\\n*   **MR spectroscopy:** NAA peaks may be reduced within plaques, which is the most common and remarkable finding. Choline and lactate are found to be increased in the acute pathologic phase.\\n\\nThe location of the plaques can be infratentorial, in the deep white matter, periventricular, juxtacortical, or mixed white matter-grey matter lesions. Even on a single scan, some features are helpful in predicting relapsing-remitting vs progressive disease. Features favoring progressive disease include large, numerous plaques and hyperintense T1 lesions.\\n',\n",

Arterial narrowing is typically seen in meningiomas which encase arteries and is a useful sign in parasellar tumors, in distinguishing a meningioma from a pituitary macroadenoma; the latter typically does not narrow vessels.\\n\\nSchwannoma:\\n\\n*   Schwannomas are well-circumscribed masses that displace adjacent structures without direct invasion.\\n*   Cystic and fatty degeneration is common.\\n*   T1: isointense or hypointense\\n*   T1 C+ (Gd): intense enhancement\\n*   T2: heterogeneously hyperintense (Antoni type A: relatively low; Antoni type B: high), cystic degenerative areas may be present, especially in larger tumors\\n*   Several signs can also be useful such as the split-fat sign, target sign, and fascicular sign.\\n',\n",

DWI/ADC commonly demonstrates restricted diffusion of the abscess content.\\n*   **Degenerative disc changes:** Degenerative changes of the disc affect hydration and elasticity of the cartilaginous endplate, annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus, with changes most pronounced in the nucleus pulposus. Within the nucleus pulposus, a loss of water-holding proteoglycans occurs, and within the annulus fibrosus type II collagen increases which reduce disc hydration as well. This makes the disc friable, precipitating fissures and progressive structural degradation. Nitrogen gas may be observed filling these defects as it is pulled from surrounding extracellular fluid, creating the vacuum cleft phenomenon.\\n\",\n",

       "  'answer': 'Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) typically manifests as bilateral vasogenic edema within the occipital and parietal regions (70-90% of cases). However, it can also be found in non-posterior distributions, mainly in watershed areas, including within the frontal, inferior temporal, cerebellar, and brainstem regions. Both cortical and subcortical locations are affected. Uncommon patterns of PRES in less than 5% of cases include purely unilateral, central (brainstem or basal ganglia involvement without cortical or subcortical white matter involvement), and spinal cord involvement.\\n\\nOn CT, the affected regions are hypoattenuating. On MRI, the signal characteristics of affected areas usually reflect vasogenic edema.\\n*   T1: hypointense in affected regions\\n*   T2: hyperintense in affected regions\\n*   DWI: usually normal, sometimes hyperintense due to edema or true restricted diffusion\\n*   ADC: usually increased signal due to increased diffusion, but restricted diffusion is present in a quarter of cases\\n*   GRE/SWI: may show hemorrhages in 9-50%\\n*   T1 C+ (Gd): patchy variable enhancement can be seen in ~35% of patients, in either a leptomeningeal or cortical pattern\\n*   MRA: may show patterns of vasculopathy with vessel irregularity consistent with focal vasoconstrictions/vasodilatation and diffuse vasoconstriction\\n*   MRV: tends to be normal',\n",
