The presence of a substantial penumbra indicates salvageable brain tissue.\n\n### Imaging Techniques:\nCT perfusion is a valuable tool for assessing the penumbra, alongside other imaging parameters like CT angiography (CTA) and conventional unenhanced CT brain imaging. MRI, particularly diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is also sensitive to early parenchymal changes of infarction but is limited by accessibility and time constraints in acute stroke settings.\n\n### Practical Considerations:\n*   CT perfusion may overestimate infarct core, especially early in the stroke, potentially misidentifying areas that will not infarct on follow-up.\n*   Factors like poor cardiac output or severe arterial stenosis can lead to inaccurate perfusion maps.\n*   Small infarcts may be poorly visualized on perfusion maps due to resolution limitations.\n\n### Summary:\nThe ischemic penumbra represents potentially salvageable brain tissue in the context of an ischemic stroke.

However, the presence of fat within a hepatic adenoma may cause it to appear hyperintense.\n*   **T2-weighted imaging**: Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) tends to be iso- to slightly hyperintense, while hepatic adenomas are often mildly hyperintense. FNH may have a hyperintense central scar.\n*   **T1 C+ (Gd)**: Both lesions show early arterial enhancement. However, FNH tends to become isointense to the liver on portal venous phase images, whereas adenomas may show centripetal filling and become nearly isointense on delayed images.\n*   **T1 C+ (Eovist/Primovist)**: This is a key differentiator. FNH typically retains contrast on hepatobiliary phase images due to the presence of functioning hepatocytes and bile ductules, appearing iso- to hyperintense. In contrast, hepatic adenomas usually appear hypointense on hepatobiliary phase due to reduced uptake of the contrast agent.\n*   **Central Scar**: FNH often has a central scar that is hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, and shows delayed enhancement. Hepatic adenomas may have hemorrhage or necrosis but typically lack a central scar.\n*   **Signal Dropout on IP/OP**: Hepatic adenomas often contain fat, leading to signal dropout on out-of-phase imaging.

It can be primary (originating in the CNS) or secondary (resulting from systemic lymphoma spreading to the CNS). Primary CNS lymphoma is typically a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\n*   **Glioblastoma (GBM)**: GBM is a type of glioma that originates from the brain's astrocytes. It is the most aggressive type of glioma and is classified as a grade IV tumor by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n*   **CNS Lymphoma**: Secondary CNS lymphoma can manifest with symptoms such as new-onset headache, cranial nerve palsies, changes in mental status, and even coma and seizures.\n*   **Glioblastoma**: The clinical presentation of GBM depends on the tumor's location and can include symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and focal neurological deficits.\n\n### Radiographic Features\n\n*   **CNS Lymphoma**: On MRI, secondary CNS lymphoma can appear as leptomeningeal, dural, subependymal, and cranial nerve enhancement. Parenchymal involvement can appear similar to primary CNS lymphoma.\n*   **Glioblastoma**: Cystic glioblastoma, a descriptive term for GBM with a large cystic component, typically appears as a well-defined intra-axial cystic lesion with peripheral ring enhancement on CT or MRI. The solid component may show restriction on DWI/ADC.\n\n### Pathology and Diagnosis\n\n*   **CNS Lymphoma**: Diagnosis is often made through a combination of imaging and CSF analysis, with malignant cells typically found on CSF aspiration.\n*   **Glioblastoma**: Diagnosis is confirmed by histology, with typical microscopic features and immunohistochemistry.\n\n### Treatment and Prognosis\n\n*   **CNS Lymphoma**: Treatment options vary depending on whether it's primary or secondary CNS lymphoma. Secondary CNS lymphoma often has a poorer prognosis due to its association with systemic disease.\n*   **Glioblastoma**: Patients with cystic glioblastoma may have a longer survival period before recurrence compared to those without a cystic component. Metastatic glioblastoma, which is rare, has a poor prognosis, although survival is not significantly worse than non-metastatic GBM in some cases.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n*   **Origin**: CNS lymphoma originates from lymphocytes, while GBM originates from astrocytes.\n*   **Imaging Characteristics**: CNS lymphoma often involves leptomeningeal or parenchymal enhancement, whereas GBM typically appears as a cystic or necrotic mass with peripheral enhancement.\n*   **Prognosis and Treatment**: Both are aggressive tumors with different treatment approaches and prognostic factors.", "urls": ["https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cns-lymphoma-1?lang=us", "https://radiopaedia.org/articles/secondary-cns-lymphoma?lang=us", "https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cystic-glioblastoma?lang=us", "https://radiopaedia.org/articles/metastatic-glioblastoma?lang=us"]}, {"query": "LAM stages ct", "search_terms": ["LAM CT staging"], "answer": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is not directly described in the provided context regarding its stages on CT.
