However, it does not capture entorhinal cortex atrophy, which occurs early in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The entorhinal cortical atrophy (ERICA) scoring system has better diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing healthy controls from those with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n### Classification\nThe MTA score is a visual score performed on MRI of the brain using coronal T1 weighted images in a plane parallel to the brainstem axis and through the hippocampus at the level of the anterior pons. The score is also validated for assessment on CT brain. Both sides are evaluated, and the higher or average score have been used for further grading. It is based on three features:\n\n*   Width of the choroid fissure\n*   Width of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle\n*   Height of the hippocampus\n\nThese features result in a score of 0 to 4:\n\n*   **0:** No CSF is visible around the hippocampus\n*   **1:** Choroid fissure is slightly widened\n*   **2:** Moderate widening of the choroid fissure, mild enlargement of the temporal horn, and mild loss of hippocampal height\n*   **3:** Marked widening of the choroid fissure, moderate enlargement of the temporal horn, and moderate loss of hippocampal height\n*   **4:** Marked widening of the choroid fissure, marked enlargement of the temporal horn, and the hippocampus is markedly atrophied and internal structure is lost\n\n### Interpretation\nThe score is interpreted in relation to age:\n\n*   <75 years: \u22652 is abnormal\n*   \u226575 years: \u22653 is abnormal\n\nA more detailed cut-off for an abnormal average score has been proposed:\n\n*   <65 years: \u22651 is abnormal\n*   65-74 years: \u22651.5 is abnormal\n*   75-84 years: \u22652 is abnormal\n*   \\>85 years: \u22652 is abnormal\n\nThe exact cut-off has limited value above the age of 85 due to the substantial decrease in sensitivity.

The callososeptal interface may have multiple small hypointense lesions (Venus necklace), or the corpus callosum may merely appear thinned. Hyperintense lesions are associated with brain atrophy and advancing disease.\n*   **T2:** Lesions are typically hyperintense. Acute lesions often have surrounding edema.\n*   **FLAIR:** Lesions are typically hyperintense. A very early sign is the ependymal dot-dash sign. When these propagate centrifugally along the medullary venules and are arranged perpendicular to the lateral ventricles in a triangular configuration (extending radially outward - best seen on parasagittal images), they are termed Dawson fingers. FLAIR is more sensitive than T2 in the detection of juxtacortical and periventricular plaques, while T2 is more sensitive to infratentorial lesions.\n*   **Double inversion recovery (DIR):** A sequence that suppresses both CSF and white matter signal and offers better delineation of the plaques compared to FLAIR.\n*   **SWI:** At higher field strengths, most plaques have been shown to be perivenular. Paramagnetic rim lesions may be seen in approximately 50% of patients; presence increases specificity of diagnosis and correlates with disability from disease.\n*   **T1 C+ (Gd):** Active lesions show enhancement. Enhancement is often incomplete around the periphery (open ring sign).\n*   **DWI/ADC:** Active plaques may demonstrate high or low ADC (increased or decreased diffusion) and also typically open ring in morphology.\n*   **PD:** PD images are better at detecting cervical spinal cord MS lesions, especially when T2W images fail to demonstrate these lesions.\n*   **MR spectroscopy:** NAA peaks may be reduced within plaques, which is the most common and remarkable finding. Choline and lactate are found to be increased in the acute pathologic phase.\n\nThe location of the plaques can be infratentorial, in the deep white matter, periventricular, juxtacortical, or mixed white matter-grey matter lesions.
