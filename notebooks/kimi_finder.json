Do not split it into separate words or drop the modality part; the exact compound phrase is what retrieves the correct Radiopaedia article.\n\nWhen the user query mentions a disease or condition along with an imaging modality (e.g., \"how does X look on MRI\"), extract only the disease\/condition name as the topic.
